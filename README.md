## NESTJs REST API Tutorial

<p>Notes from NestJs <a href="https://youtu.be/GHTA143_b-s">YouTube Tutorial</a> by @codewithvlad </p>

<p>Wouldn't necessarily recommend the video for NestJs CRUD REST API because it does not take advantage of the NextJs CRUD generator - at all.  It's not even mentioned.  However, the application integrates Prisma and there is an extensive treatment of testing worthwhile for future reference.</p>
